# TPDE Compiler Back-End Framework

TPDE is a fast compiler back-end framework that adapts to existing SSA IRs.
The primary goal is low-latency compilation while maintaining reasonable (`-O0`) code quality, e.g., as baseline compiler for JIT compilation or unoptimized builds.
TPDE targets ELF-based x86-64 and AArch64 (Armv8.1) platforms, with experimental support for Mach-O object emission and native JIT execution on macOS ARM64.
See the [macOS platform notes](docs/macos.md) for requirements and limitations.

This repository contains:

- TPDE: the core compiler framework.
- TPDE-Encodegen: a utility for easing the use of TPDE by deriving code generators through LLVM's Machine IR.
- TPDE-LLVM: a standalone back-end for LLVM-IR, which compiles 10--20x faster than LLVM -O0 with similar code quality, usable as library (e.g., for JIT), as tool (`tpde-llc`), and integrated in Clang/Flang (with a patch).
